# Tableau Project Enhancing Financial Inclusion
This project explores the landscape of financial inclusion in the United States with a focus on identifying
and addressing barriers faced by underserved communities. Leveraging data from sources such as the
U.S. Census Bureau, FDIC, and BEA, we performed comprehensive data analysis and visualization using
Tableau. Our study reveals significant disparities in financial access, particularly among low-income and
rural populations. Key findings include a high percentage of unbanked and underbanked households,
strong correlations between economic indicators and financial inclusion, and demographic factors
influencing access to financial services. We encountered challenges in data consistency and integration,
which were addressed through meticulous data cleaning and merging processes. Our recommendations
included a digital banking marketplace with family banking initiative for deeper inclusion. This project
underscores the importance of data-driven strategies in enhancing financial inclusion, providing valuable
insights to drive policy and operational improvements in the financial sector.
